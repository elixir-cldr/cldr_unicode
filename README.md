# Cldr.Unicode

Functions to return information about Unicode codepoints.

The information functions are heavily inspired by [@qqwy's elixir-unicode package](https://github.com/Qqwy/elixir-unicode) and compatibility with some of the api is represented by including some of the doctests from that package.


### To do
* Use emoji sequences, not codepoints
* Flag mapping from ISO3166 to emoji
